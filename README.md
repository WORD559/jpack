# jpack

**JPACK IS NOW DEPRECATED!**

I'm keeping the repo up because it was a fun project and I'd like to port it over to Python 3, but the code base in the end was pretty unkempt and unmaintainable. Binary file operations were all done manually when I probably should've used `struct`, and I've completely lost track now of how everything worked. When I get an opportunity, I intend to rebuild jpack from the ground up, hopefully with some compatibility mode for the old structure. Stay tuned.

A method of packing Python data in binary files.

jpack is compatible with Python 2.7 *only*. It is currently not compatible with Python 3.
